STRING PARSER 2.10 by Tymon Kubik

Hi there :)
*Thank you very much for trying out my string parser,
it took me a lot of effort to make this work at runtime!!!

    - "It's not like im going to buy an extension for 30$!!! Im gonna make it myself >:)"

Anyways, here's the Documentation:
        --- Avalabile arythmetical operators ---
            +
            -
            *
            /
            %
            <
            >
            ==
            !=
            <=
            >=
            and (&&)
            or (||)
            xor (|)
            Ternary Operator: 'var variable = condition ? value_true : value_false'

HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN INSTANCE:
    1) Use "with(instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_custom)) { // Code here }".
       You should replace "x" and "y" with your 
       desired position. This will create a blank "obj_custom" in the current room.
    2) For your instance to run GML events like a 'normal' GameMaker instance,
       you will need to set them as functions using those instance variables:
           event_create, event_destroy, event_step, event_beginstep,
           event_draw, event_drawgui, event_roomstart, event_roomend
    3) Your functions should be simply defined like this:
       "variablename = function() { // Code here }".
       Any variables used in these functions will be set to the instance.

    FULL EXAMPLE:
    "with (instance_create_layer(room_width / 2, room_height / 2, "Instances", obj_custom)) {
         sprite_index = spr_test1;

         event_step = function() {
             var key_sound = keyboard_check_pressed(ord("Z"));
             
             if key_sound {
                 audio_play_sound(sfx_noise, 1, false);
             }
         }
     }"

NOTES / TODO:
    - You should ALWAYS put a ";" at the end of each line!
      (except for the statements that need "{}")
    - Variables can be declared with nothing, "var ", or "global." before their names,
      but when using "with" and declaring without a prefix will set the variable on the instance
    - You can store custom defined functions in a variable! (ex: "var _func = function() {}")
    - Parentheses work!
    - Single-line comments (//) and multiple-line comments (/* */) work!
    - Array setting and getting is done using the functions "array_set" and "array_get"
      (no "array[index]" for now)
    - Struct setting and getting is also only possible by using the functions
      "struct_set" and "struct_get"
    - idk what to put here
